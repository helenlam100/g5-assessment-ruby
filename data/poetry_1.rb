    And clap their hands together, and half close their eyes,
    For they will ride the North when the ger-eagle flies,
    With heavy whitening wings, and a heart fallen cold:
    I kiss my wailing child and press it to my breast,
    And hear the narrow graves calling my child and me.
    Desolate winds that cry over the wandering sea;
    Desolate winds that hover in the flaming West;
    Desolate winds that beat the doors of Heaven, and beat
    The doors of Hell and blow there many a whimpering ghost;
    O heart the winds have shaken; the unappeasable host
    Is comelier than candles before Mauryaâ€™s feet."}

#after 1 hour I figured out how to print each file, I kept looking up glob as per the link in the README but this didn't allow me to read and print each file.
#now figure out how to parse title, author, and poem into a hash.

#Parse the title, author and verses. Hmm look up JSON.parse
#so didn't finish but am figuring out how to now: (i) parse hash by each line on the txt code rather than each word, or hard coding it which I've done above.
#I think I may need to use yml or json. I didn't have enough time to research. OR I  need to find a way to separate each line in the txt file and run the code.

#make everything a hash
